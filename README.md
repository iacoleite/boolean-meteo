- Displays current weather conditions, temperature, and give a suggestion in italian, based on the user's location or a searched location.
- User-friendly interface for a smooth experience.
  
### Important:

Before running the application, you need to create an API key for each service and store them in a separate file named config.js located in the same directory as your main HTML file.

Instructions:

Create a file named config.js:

JavaScript

let GEOCODE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GEOCODE_API_KEY';
let OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY';

Replace the placeholders:
